[8.879s] You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
[8.879s] changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
[8.879s] state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
[8.880s] 
[8.880s] If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
[8.880s] do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
[8.880s] 
[8.880s]   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
[8.880s] 
[8.880s] Or undo this operation with:
[8.881s] 
[8.881s]   git switch -
